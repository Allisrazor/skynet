## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to skynet](https://github.com/Tyill/skynet/pull/new/master) 
with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/). 


Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
